# Goldmine

A simple, [fortune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)) cookie library for Ruby.
Goldmine provides access to the contents of a fortune file. The fortune file is a database
which contains fortunes â€• funny, offensive, serious and reflective (very rarely) quotes, jokes, or poems. [Example](http://github.com/Archetylator/goldmine/blob/master/fortunes/fortunes).

Goldmine allows to create and read a data file which describes the database.
Such a file is called an index. The index always has the same name as the database, but ends with a ".dat" extension. The index created by Goldmine is
compatible with a [fortune program](http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/freebsd/head/games/fortune/fortune/fortune.c) written by [Ken Arnold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Arnold).

Install
--------

```shell
gem install goldmine
```
or add this to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "goldmine"
```
and run `bundle install` command.

Getting Started
----------------

Create a Goldmine::DB instance that points to a fortune file. After that you have access to that collection via a few methods.

```ruby
db = Goldmine::DB.new(path: "/home/user/fortunes")
puts db.random # Throws a random fortune
puts db.fortunes # Returns all fortunes
```

If you don't pass the file path, Goldmine will use default fortunes database which was prepared by [Brian M. Clapper](https://github.com/bmc/fortunes/).

### Options

By passing `comments: true` option you specify that your fortunes collection includes comments. A comment is identified as a double delimiter at the begging of the line.

You could also define a delimiter by passing `delim: "character"` option. The default delimiter is a percent sign.

```ruby
Goldmine::DB.new(path: "/my/fortunes/path", comments: true, delim: "#")
```

### Database with an index

If you need to access the database using the index, use Goldmine::IDB class.

```ruby
Goldmine::IDB.new(path: "/my/fortunes/path")
```

You can't pass options to Goldmine::IDB because all options are extracted from the index file.

### Fortune

An instance of Goldmine::Fortune class represents a single fortune. Wherever Goldmine returns a single fortune or bundle of them in fact it returns Goldmine::Fortune instances.

```ruby
fortune = Goldmine::DB.new.random
fortune.content # Returns a body of the fortune
fortune.attribution # Returns an attribution if exists
```

### Create an index

You can pass many options when creating an instance. To learn about all the possibilities, please see the documentation.

```ruby
writer = Goldmine::IndexWriter.new("/path/to/database")
writer.write
```
